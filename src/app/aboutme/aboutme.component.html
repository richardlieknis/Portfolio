          Hey, I'm an aspiring frontend junior developer from DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. 
          With a passion for web design and user experience, I have gained solid 
          skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as Angular and TypeScript. 
          My joy in creating intuitive, aesthetic user interfaces drives me.
          I'm curious and looking for new opportunities to expand my skills. 
          <br><br>If you're looking for a committed front-end developer working on 
          great digital experiences, I'm available. Let's get into a conversation!
